What is Haircomb?
--------------------

Haircomb is an anonymous, quantum-proof cryptocurrency that is hidden within the transactions of the Bitcoin Core blockchain. Haircomb was created by someone using the name Natasha Otomoski, who published a `whitepaper`_ about Haircomb on October 25, 2019. She worked on developing Haircomb until June 2020, at which point she made the project open-source and disappeared.

Haircomb has a unique coinbase; every BTC block, COMB is spawned. If you take the proper steps, you can be the one to claim it. If nobody claims it, then it is burned forever.
